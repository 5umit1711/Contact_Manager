# Contact Management System

## Description

The *Contact Management System* is a web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). This system allows users to *add*, *edit*, *delete*, and *view* their contacts. It provides an easy-to-use interface to manage personal or professional contacts effectively. The backend API is built with Node.js and Express, while the frontend is built using React.

## Features

- Add new contacts
- Edit existing contacts
- Delete contacts
- View contacts in a list
